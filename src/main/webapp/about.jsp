      <h1>About the Baker's Dozen CodeU Chat App</h1>
      <p>
        The Baker's Dozen Chat App began as a Google CodeU chat app template from which we built
        off of throughout the 2018 Summer. Born and bred on the West Coast with a passion for Computer Science and problem solving,
        the Baker's Dozen team consists of Los Angeles natives Gaby Cortes and Talia Bahar and Bay Area native Luke Mujica.
        This Chat App represents a combination of the unique skill sets we came into the prgram with in conjunction with the
        new knowledge we gained from our Google mentors (Shoutout Edrei Chua), peers, and each other.

        Here's some stuff to think about:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algorithms and data structures:</strong> We've made the app
            and the code as simple as possible. You will have to extend the
            existing data structures to support your enhancements to the app,
            and also make changes for performance and scalability as your app
            increases in complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Look and feel:</strong> The focus of CodeU is on the Java
          side of things, but if you're particularly interested you might use
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the chat app prettier.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Think about a group you care about.
          What needs do they have? How could you help? Think about technical
          requirements, privacy concerns, and accessibility and
          internationalization.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is your code now. Get familiar with it and get comfortable
        working with your team to plan and make changes. Start by updating the
        homepage and this about page to tell your users more about your team.
        This page should also be used to describe the features and improvements
        you've added.
