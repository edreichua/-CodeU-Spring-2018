      <h1>About the Baker's Dozen CodeU Chat App</h1>
      <p>
        The Baker's Dozen Chat App began as a Google CodeU chat app template from which we built
        off of throughout the 2018 Summer. Born and bred on the West Coast with a passion for Computer Science and problem solving,
        the Baker's Dozen team consists of Los Angeles natives Gaby Cortes and Talia Bahar and Bay Area native Luke Mujica.
        This Chat App represents a combination of the unique skill sets we came into the prgram with in conjunction with the
        new knowledge we gained from our Google mentors (Shoutout Edrei Chua), peers, and each other. Over the course of
        this program we worked on enhancing user profile pages and implementing a notification system
        for when users are tageed in chat messages.
